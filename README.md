python module for creating genetic algorithms

To use the genetic algorithm in you code, 

1) Import the module
2) Create a Population object with at least 4 Chromosomes.
3) Define a Fitness Function(some method for determining how favorable a particular Chromosome is).
4) Create a Context Object, passing your Fitness Function and Population as arguments.
